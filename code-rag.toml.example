# ==========================================
# DATABASE PATH
# ==========================================
# The location where vector data and index files are stored.
#
# WINDOWS USERS: Use single quotes to avoid escaping backslashes.
# Correct:   db_path = 'C:\Users\Name\.code-rag\db'
# Incorrect: db_path = "C:\Users\Name\.code-rag\db" (Invalid Escape Error)
#
# Defaults to "./.lancedb" if not specified.
db_path = './.lancedb'

# ==========================================
# DEFAULT INDEX PATH
# ==========================================
# The directory to scan when running `code-rag index` without arguments.
# Defaults to "." (current directory).
#
# WINDOWS USERS: Use single quotes for paths.
# Example: default_index_path = 'C:\Projects\MyRepo'
default_index_path = '.'

# Merge Policy for BM25 Indexing
# Options:
# "log" (Default) - Balanced read/write performance.
# "fast-write" - Optimized for high-throughput indexing (larger segments).
# "fast-search" - Optimized for search latency (smaller segments, more merging).
merge_policy = "log"


# ==========================================
# SUPPORTED EXTENSIONS
# ==========================================
# Code-RAG uses Tree-sitter for AST parsing. Only the following extensions
# vary by their language grammar and are currently indexed:
#
# Rust:       .rs
# Python:     .py
# Go:         .go
# C/C++:      .c, .h, .cpp, .hpp, .cc, .cxx
# JavaScript: .js, .jsx
# TypeScript: .ts, .tsx
# Java:       .java
# C#:         .cs
# Ruby:       .rb
# PHP:        .php
# Web:        .html, .css
#
# Note: Generic text files (.txt, .md) are NOT currently indexed 
# because they lack a structured AST grammar.

# Future options (currently reserved):
# [indexing]
# exclude_patterns = ["target/", "node_modules/", ".git/"]
